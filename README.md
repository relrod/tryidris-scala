# tryidris-api

This is a client-side library which provides interaction with the awesome
tryidris.org JSON API, by Brian McKenna.

It is written with the intention of eventually being used in an Android app,
but it is in no way tied to that usecase.

It makes use of the Argonaut library and scalaz.
